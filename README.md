# Advanced Databases: Second project

This project was part of the course Advanced Databases of the Data Science and Engineering degree of Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Fall 2021, done in collaboration with Lena. Sadly I can't find the original projet description.

The project consists on building an ETL and machine learning process that predicts whether an aircraft will soon need maintanance given previous sensor data.

There are 3 main phases, ETL, training of the model and prediction.

The project is done using PySpark. A sketch of the pipelines is given in pipeline_sketch.png.
